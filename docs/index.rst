basic-remote-shell
==================

Minimum code needed to connect to a OpenSSH Server.

Note: This dose **NOT** attempt to be a *conformant* implementation. Its goal is to take every shortcut in creating low-traffic, short lived sessions to modern OpenSSH servers.

Note: Whilst my aim is keep this secure; I don't know what I am doing and you **MUST** assume it isn't.
